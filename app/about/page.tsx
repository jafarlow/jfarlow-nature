      <h2>About the Project</h2>

      {/* TODO: link these to their subsections */}
      <p>This project represents two parts of myself: Jacob as Nature Photographer, and Jacob as Software Engineer. What follows is a bit of autobiographical waxing poetic combined with being overly verbose.</p>

      <h3>Jacob as Nature Photographer--from the early days to now</h3>
      <h4>HEADING: the beginnings</h4>
      <p>My photography journey began when I was about 8 years old, though admittedly, it was probably more of a way for my parents to help me expend energy on family vacations. Prior to our departure, my folks would pack a treat bag full of snacks and puzzle games that were to last us the duration of whatever vaction we were embarking upon, and this included a disposable Kodak camera.</p> 
      <p>Over many trips and the efforts of my mother to turn these rolls into scrapbooks, my folks must have seen something among the mess that resulted from a small rambunctious child given free reign to photograph whatever caught his eye. It was 'round about when I was 14 that my parents upgraded me from disposable Kodak to an Olympus digital point-and-shoot.</p>

      <h4>HEADING: There might just be something in this here hobby</h4>
      <p>TOPIC: photo contest ski slope & Cedarock Park waterfall + painting</p>
      <p>Not long after this, I had the opportunity to bring this camera with me on the ski slopes of West Virginia's Winterplace ski resort. After tackling one of the runs, I turned around to look back up and thought to myself that it would make a pretty picture. I fell on my stomach, pulled out the camera, and snapped this photo:</p> {/* INSERT PHOTO "/My Pictures/ski trip/feb 7 05 (2)" */}
      <p>I entered this photo into a local arts competition and took first prize, to my utter astonishment and delight. This moment, more than anything, triggered my desire to incporporate photography into my definition of self.</p>
      <p>A few months after, I was taking a hike in one of my favorite places on the planet--Cedarock Park in Burlington, North Carolina. It holds a special place in my heart for many reasons, and one relevant to this project is it's where I learned that my "photographic eye" wasn't a fluke on the ski slopes. I took a photo of the park's iconic dam-<i>cum</i>-waterfall that cemented in my mind that landscapes and features within nature would be my forte.</p> {/* INSERT PHOTO "/My Pictures/fire/stuff 010" */}
      <p>A few short years later, as a part of an art class we were directed to reproduce an image as a painting in the pointilist style. Without hesitation, I chose that photo from Cedarock Park as my subject.</p>
      <p>TOPIC: carrying it with me everywhere</p>
      <p>The beautiful simplicity of a digital point-and-shoot camera is how easy it is to carry everywhere. I developed a habit of sacrificing one of my pants pockets to hold this camera every single day. One might think this would lead to an abundance of photos from daily life, however that isn't how I viewed photography--I saw it as an opportunity to record the unusual, the special, the unexpected. While this means I carried it always, and used it rarely, it did mean I was prepared when in chemisty class we learned about surface area, licopodium powder, and explosions.</p>{/* INSERT PHOTO "/My Pictures/fire/P1010170" */}
      <p>In this moment I unlocked a new aspect of my photography: capturing moments of motion. It would take some dabbling in sports photography and plenty of "almost got it" experiences over the subsequent years before I would combine "movement" with "nature". But let's don't get ahead of the story.</p>

      <h4>HEADING: taking the (financial) plunge</h4>
      <p>TOPIC: borrowing Barbara's camera & upgrading to DSLR</p>
      <p>The seed was planted about upgrading my camera once again when a family friend learned of my interest in photography. She had a DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) camera, and when my family went for a visit she suggested I give her camera a try. Aside from the joy in trying out a new camera, I was honored that someone would trust 16 year old me with such an expensive piece of equipment. I spent an entire afternoon traipsing about their garden and forested property delighting in the new views I could explore. It would take another 3 years, but I took that financial plunge and purchased a Canon 40D, with a 35-128mm telephoto lens. This was one model removed from state of the art in Canon's lineup (at the time), with the basic all-around lens for someone on a budget who wants to diversify their subject matter. (A quick aside on telephoto lenses -- these are lenses which allow for manual zooming, which is to say the shape of the lens changes & elongates by hand, so the numbers 35-128 means non-zoomed the lens focal length is 35mm and at full zoom it'll be 128mm). An SLR or DSLR camera is special in that it allows for interchangeable lenses, enabling people to adjust their focus (pun absolutely intended!) and reach. Without needing to buy a whole new camera, a photographer can swap out compatible lenses.</p>
      <p>TOPIC: Italy/Switzerland</p>
      <p>Just like breaking in running shoes before a race, I learned the hard way that I should have had taken the same approach with this camera. A week after it arrived, we hopped on an airplane to visit Japan. Aside from having a wonderful time as a tourist, my photographic foray there was, predicatbly, about on par with my old point-and-shoot. Thankfully, I had a blast with it the whole time, and so rather than be discouraged I was motivated to improve.</p>
      <p>I had the opportunity of a lifetime to study for a semester in Italy, with an embarrassment of riches of subject matter: architecture, art, gardens, ruins, vistas. It was during this time that my landscape photography really began to establish itself as a cornerstone of my skillset. The majority of my travels during this time kept me in Italy, though I did take a jaunt up to Switzerland to knock off a bucket list item of hitting the slopes of the Swiss Alps. I took a big risk by bringing my camera with me; afterall, it's a large piece of precision equipment, and knocking it around is not generally advisable. The risk paid off in a big way, giving me both my greatest moment in action photography (see below), as well as in landscape photography (see landscapes in the gallery).</p>

      <p>TOPIC: travels, photo subjects/targets, successes & frustrations</p>
      <p>Hitting it big right off the bat like this (only 6 months of owning the camera) set myself up to be humbled, experiencing my own version of the Dunning-Kruger Effect. While I saved my ego by not broadcasting to others how great I thought myself, I fell victim to overconfidence internally, and so when subsequent forays into beautiful places didn't render the same astounding results I had some emotional damage control to do. Intense self reflection combined with treating each excursion as a learning opportunity righted the ship, so to speak, and quickly converted frustrations into improvements.</p>
      <p>TOPIC: BBC docs</p>
      <p>Since the BBC launched <i>Planet Earth</i> in 2006 I've been fascinated with natural history documentaries. It took hold in a big way in 2019 as I found sources for much of the BBC's legacy content and "smaller" programs, which led to me binge watching these nearly every day for over a year as I worked through the catalogue. Most pivotal for me during this period was exposure to their Watch series--<i>Springwatch</i>, <i>Autumnwatch</i>, and <i>Winterwatch</i>--whose focus turns in a different direction than the major productions to which I was accustomed. Rather than being centered on "exotic" wildlife from remote locations, the Watch series is all about local nature and wildlife, those things folks can observe themselves without great expense or difficulty. It flipped a switch in my mind: I could do this too; I have local wildlife, I could do my own exploring! It seems like a no-brainer after the fact, but up to this point photography to me generally meant a big effort excursion.</p>

      <p>TOPIC: searching for a project to build as practice</p>

      <h4>HEADING: building this portfolio</h4>
      <p>TOPIC: Cloudinary API & host</p>
      <p>ðŸŽ¼ <i>It started with a whisperrrr...</i> ðŸŽ¶ <br /> Wait, no. It started with a tutorial. I wanted to learn more about backend engineering, to get re-exposed to Nodejs & Express. I found a video from Chris Blakely covering full stack development with React/Node/Express to build out a photo gallery, and an API called Cloudinary, which I had never heard of before then. Given my background (see the wall of text above) I was immediately interested. Afterall, one of the fundamental things about how I learn is to establish a personal connection to the subject matter. I like coding along to tutorials like this one as a way to learn how other people structure their code, and how they go from a blank file to a completed project. And once I've reached the end of a tutorial, I take it farther: Is it accessible? Are there edge cases that need to be considered? How can I expand upon or otherwise modify what I coded along with? Can I incorporate something from one tutorial into another one? Are there projects I already have completed that could be refactored with my new experience?</p>
      <p>This project was no different, and it was during these explorations that I decided to upgrade this from a practice project to something I wanted to publish to the world. More specifically, the idea took root when I was exploring Cloudinary's capabilities and I learned I could add custom metadata fields. </p>
      {/*TALK ABOUT CUSTOM METADATA FIELDS*/}
      <p>When thinking about having a portfolio for my work, I spent a lot of time pondering how I would accomplish this. Would I use a webhost, whose specialty is catering to photographers like myself? Would I use a generic web template and then customize it to suit my needs?</p>
      <p>I decided on a third option, which was to build this from the ground up. This was the perfect opportunity to grow and expand my engineer skillset, to build something with a purpose.</p>
      <p>TOPIC: Nextjs framework + TS</p>
      <p>When it came time to deploy the project into production, I realized I hadn't taken into consideration what it means to have a full stack application running live--my previous experience was mostly with front-end only projects, plus a few minor backends from my time at General Assembly with student hosting on Heroku. I learned there's a big gap between local development and live deployment of a server, and came to the conclusion that I was going about it all wrong.</p>
