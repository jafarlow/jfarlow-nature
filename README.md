Thoughts:

I'm not certain I want to use routing, as it's an SPA. Perhaps need to rewrite the current route as a lib function that gets called in a useEffect

Still need components for the images themselves, as well as the imageviewer

Currently have a support ticket open with Cloudinary about CORS errors I'm getting with a fetch from the client component

Need to build:
 - Navbar
 - Footer
 - About (more fleshed out)
  - Test out functionality for rotating profile images at random
 - Include the rest of the CSS from React/Node version of this project

After it's up and running in dev with the code as is, need to explore how to componentize(?) parts of the code for simplification
